public class ArrayMerging {

    /*
    * Our startup has two databases containing important information, both sorted in non-decreasing order.
    * We need to efficiently merge the two databases into a single sorted array to process the data.
    * Can you write a function that takes in the two arrays and returns a merged array sorted in non-decreasing order?
    *
    * Example 1:
    *
    *   arr1 = {1, 3, 5, 7};
    *   arr2 = {2, 4, 6, 8};
    *   mergedArr should be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
    *
    *
    * Example 2:
    *   arr1 = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    *   arr2 = {5, 6, 7, 8};
    *   mergedArr should be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
