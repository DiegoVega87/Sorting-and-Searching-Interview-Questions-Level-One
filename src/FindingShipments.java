    /*
    * As a startup in the logistics industry, we have a massive matrix containing information about different shipments.
    * We need to quickly search for a specific shipment based on its unique identifier and are looking for an algorithm
    * that can efficiently search for the target value in the 2D matrix.
    * The algorithm should return True if the identifier is found, else False.
    *
    * Example 1:
    *   matrix = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
    *   target = 5;
    *   Output: true
    *
    * Example 2:
    *   int[][] matrix = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
    *   target = 10;
    *   Output: False
